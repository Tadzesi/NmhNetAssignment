# .NET Senior Developer Task

A Web API application demonstrating key-value storage, RabbitMQ integration, and Entity Framework Core configuration.

## Technical Stack

- Language: C#
- Framework: .NET 8
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Message Broker: RabbitMQ
- Container Orchestration: Docker Compose

## Project Requirements

### 1. Web API Endpoint

The application exposes the following REST API endpoint:
- **Method**: POST
- **Route**: `/Calculation/{key:int}`
- **Body**: `{"input": decimal}`
- **Media Type**: text/json

### 2. Key-Value Storage Implementation

The application implements an in-memory key-value storage with the following rules:
- If the key doesn't exist in storage, create it with value = 2
- If the key exists but is older than 15 seconds, reset value to 2
- Otherwise, calculate the new value using the formula:
  ```
  output = âˆ›(ln(input) / current_storage_value)
  ```

### 3. Response Format

The endpoint returns a JSON response in the following format:
```json
{
    "computed_value": "newly calculated value stored in global storage",
    "input_value": "original input value",
    "previous_value": "previous value from global storage"
}
```

### 4. RabbitMQ Integration

- Calculation results are sent to a RabbitMQ queue
- A background service listens to the queue and logs messages to the console

### 5. Entity Framework Core Configuration

The application includes EF Core configuration for the following models:
- Author
- Article
- Site
- Image

Key features:
- Fluent API configuration
- Explicit relationship mapping
- Automatic migration application on startup

#### Database Schema

```
Author
- Id (PK)
- Name (Unique Index)
- One-to-One relationship with Image

Article
- Id (PK)
- Title (Index)
- Many-to-Many relationship with Author
- One-to-Many relationship with Site

Site
- Id (PK)
- CreatedAt

Image
- Id (PK)
- Description
```

## Setup and Deployment

### Docker Compose

The application is containerized using Docker Compose with the following services:
1. Web API application
2. RabbitMQ
3. PostgreSQL

To run the application:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## Project Structure

The solution includes:
1. ASP.NET Web API project
2. Entity Framework Core configurations
3. RabbitMQ integration
4. Background service for message processing
5. Docker configuration files
6. Implemted FluentValidation and MediatR in CalculationController

## Input Validation

The application includes appropriate input validation for:
- Route parameters
- Request body
- Data type constraints

## Note

- The key-value storage is implemented using native .NET capabilities
- Storage is in-memory only and not persisted
- Database migrations are applied automatically on application startup
- No CRUD operations implementation is required for the database models
